# Test Baseline

This directory contains the executable regression baseline for the current RAG maintenance phase.

**When you add a test file, register it in the two lists below in the same PR.** Both lists are
hand-maintained: `npm test` discovers files through `tests/**/*.test.js` and pytest through
`python_files = test_*.py` in `pytest.ini`, so a missing entry never stops a test from running - it
only makes that file invisible to anyone auditing coverage against this document, which is how an
already-covered behaviour ends up being read as uncovered. The directory itself is the source of
truth; when a list and the tree disagree, `ls tests/*.test.js tests/test_*.py tests/conftest.py`
and `python -m pytest tests --collect-only` win. (`tests/e2e/*.spec.mjs` is the Playwright suite
run by `npm run test:e2e` and is deliberately in neither list.)

## Node Tests

Requires Node.js **>= 22.15**. `chatStore.test.js` imports `module.registerHooks`, which Node
documents as *Added in: v23.5.0, v22.15.0*; on Node 18/20 and 22.0-22.14 that import fails and
`node --test` counts the file as failed, so the whole `npm test` run exits non-zero - not just
that one file. The 23.x line needs **23.5+** (23.0.0-23.4.x lacks the export); 24+ is fine.

The floor is declared in `engines.node` (`>=22.15`) in `package.json` and in the environment
list in `README.md`; keep the three in sync. `npm install` / `npm ci` prints an `EBADENGINE`
warning when the running Node does not satisfy `engines.node`. Because `>=22.15` is a plain
floor it also admits the EOL 23.0.0-23.4.x releases, which this check rejects:

```bash
node -e "const [M,m]=process.versions.node.split('.').map(Number); process.exit((M===22&&m>=15)||(M===23&&m>=5)||M>=24?0:1)"
```

The workflows in `.github/workflows/` pin `node-version: "22"`, which resolves to the latest
22.x and therefore sits above the floor - nothing in CI runs at 22.15.0 itself. To cover the
floor locally, pin it with any version manager and run the suite from the repository root:

```bash
nvm install 22.15.0 && nvm use 22.15.0    # or fnm/asdf with the same version
npm ci && npm test                        # exits 0
nvm use 22.14.0 && npm test               # exits 1: chatStore.test.js fails to load
```

Re-run this whenever `engines.node` or the tests' API usage changes; 22.14.0 is the cheap
half of the check, since a floor that is too low only shows up on the version below it.

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
npm test
```

The test script uses `tests/**/*.test.js`, so future nested Node test files that
end in `.test.js` are included as well.

These tests cover frontend stream parsing, stream response errors, chat store conversation switching, stale in-flight response handling and fallback reset events, knowledge file detail preview ordering (a late response from a previously opened file must not rewrite the current one, and closing the dialog discards in-flight requests), clipboard fallback behavior, knowledge batch delete and upload feedback helpers, the shared delete confirmation orchestration (user cancel, API rejection, and success outcomes), the upload-type whitelist staying in sync with the backend's accepted extensions (a static cross-check against `backend/service/utils_service.py`), HTML sanitization of rendered markdown (script/style/event-handler stripping, the element allowlist, and disallowed elements being dropped together with their content), URL normalization and link safety, display formatting, status helpers, image validation, the CI gate scripts (`scripts/check_issue.mjs`, `scripts/check_pr_body.mjs` and their shared `scripts/lib/markdown_sanitize.mjs`: the comment sanitizer's invariants - no comment start marker left behind, no section heading deleted by an unpaired marker - plus both gates' pass/fail verdicts on the fixtures in `tests/fixtures/ci-gate/`, including the code-fence behaviour that is deliberate rather than an oversight), memory trace helpers, and the mounted-SFC layer for `TraceVariableFlow.vue` (`traceVariableFlowMount.test.js`: `@vue/compiler-sfc` compiles the real SFC, jsdom hosts it and Element Plus supplies the real `el-switch`, so the assertions cover the main-line/branch classification, the only-main-line and expand-branch switch linkage including the reset of the expand state, the variable inspector's selection, same-name upstream/downstream wiring and full-value rendering, and the clipboard toast paths - see the file header for which of the component's two state-sync watchers is reachable from the UI and which one is not), and the delete call-site glue that only exists once the view is real (`knowledgeDeleteCallSiteMount.test.js`: the actual `Knowledge.vue` is mounted and its actual buttons are clicked, with only one module boundary replaced - the HTTP egress in `api/request.js` - so the assertions land on which requests were really issued and which toasts were really raised, namely that the `status !== DELETE_SUCCEEDED` short-circuit really does block the follow-up refresh and that the refresh really is sent when it does not, across all three delete entry points; it is the layer between `knowledgeFeedback.test.js`, which calls the helpers directly with injected doubles, and `knowledgeViewWiring.test.js`, which only reads the source statically), and the create dialog's cross-request ordering (`knowledgeCreateDialogStaleSubmitMount.test.js`: the real `Knowledge.vue` is mounted with only the HTTP egress replaced, so whether the dialog is open is read off the component's own reactive state rather than a stubbed flag; issue #156 is that cancelling a create does not cancel the request, so when the user reopened the dialog and started typing a new name the late response still ran the success branch and closed it unconditionally - the cases pin a monotonic submit sequence that invalidates the in-flight submission both when the dialog is opened and when it is closed, and the controls prove the guard is not bought by breaking anything else, namely that the same late response is still applied when the request finished before the cancellation, that back-to-back creates each close their own dialog, that a late response must not clear a newer submission's in-flight state, and that a guard which invalidated every submission would be caught as killing legitimate ones; the reopening case additionally pins that invalidating the submission leaves the new session usable rather than inheriting its in-flight state - the abandoned submission's `finally` no longer clears the submitting flag and the reset that does is on the dialog's close hook, which is precisely the hook that path skips). The mounted-SFC layer also covers `Knowledge.vue`'s upload entry (`knowledgeUploadCallSiteMount.test.js`: a real `change` event on the hidden file input drives the whole chain, and the assertions pin the complete `ElMessage` array rather than a subset, so an upload whose follow-up list refresh fails keeps the success toast and adds only a refresh-failure message, while a genuine upload failure still reports as one). `userAvatarSrc.test.js` is the browser-side half of issue #186 (`test_uploads_anonymous_read_186.py` proves the route still serves the owner who brings a token, but `<img src>` cannot carry an `Authorization` header, so the same fix would also hide every user's own avatar - a regression no backend case can see), and it runs the real store with only `api/user.js` and `api/auth.js` replaced: the avatar is fetched with the token and handed to `<img>` as an object URL, a missing avatar or one that is not a local path issues no request at all, a failed fetch does not bubble and leaves the initial-letter fallback, replacing an avatar revokes the old object URL while a superseded fetch's late response never produces one, `logout()` revokes and clears, and both avatar-rendering views (`Layout.vue` and `UserProfile.vue`) are read statically to pin that they bind the store's `avatarSrc` rather than rebuilding the stored path - the layer where a view that still used the stored path would keep every assertion above green while the avatar stayed 401 in the browser, and the rest of the SFC mount layer from issue #180, whose gap was that `git grep mountSfc tests/` reached only two components (`Knowledge.vue` and `TraceVariableFlow.vue`): `knowledgeRenameCallSiteMount.test.js` drives the rename branch end to end - the current base is switched to the second one first so that "the selection stayed put" cannot pass by coincidence - and pins the name prefill, the same-name short-circuit, that the sidebar and the current selection both follow the renamed base, and that a failing sidebar refetch still upserts the renamed base without leaking an unhandled rejection; `markdownRendererMount.test.js` mounts the renderer itself, so "the HTML it produces is sanitised" is proven by execution instead of by the comment in `markdownSanitize.test.js` (an observing wrapper around `utils/sanitizeHtml.js` records what the renderer handed in and what came back, the mounted DOM must equal the sanitised output, and a control case with the sanitiser bypassed proves the payload really would reach the DOM, so the negative assertions cannot pass vacuously); `chatViewMount.test.js` drives a question through a real streaming response and reads the answer off the real `MarkdownRenderer` child; `layoutViewMount.test.js` clicks the sidebar menu and pins that the route and the active item move together; `loginViewMount.test.js` covers the credential payload, the form-level error, the `redirect` target and that real validation blocks the request; `userProfileViewMount.test.js` covers the password change both ways (success clears all three fields and sends neither the confirmation field nor anything else, failure keeps them) plus the avatar's local file validation; and `knowledgeDeleteCallSiteMount.test.js` no longer replaces `utils/confirm.js` at all, so both of the confirm dialog's exits - cancel returning silently and confirm driving the delete plus its refresh - are executed against the real `ElMessageBox`, whose stated blocker in `helpers/stubConfirm.js` (a missing `HTMLInputElement` global) had already been removed by the mount helper's element-class list and was therefore stale rather than true. `fileListRequest.test.js` also carries the knowledge file list's on-demand paging, which is the half of issue #191 that keeps the backend's new page-size cap from making older files disappear without a trace: the first request asks for one row more than a page so `exactly full` and `already exhausted` stay distinguishable, the cursor is the last id of the loaded range rather than of the array, a page that arrives stale after a knowledge-base switch is dropped instead of being appended to the new base's list, and once a short page has said there is nothing more, a further `loadMore` issues no request at all.

These tests cover retrieval planning and fusion, chat service retrieval wiring, auth token validation, boundary modules that had no test reference before (trace SSE framing and the safe-trace wrappers, RAG generation argument forwarding and laziness, OSS host/signing/PUT requests, and vision question construction with image analysis classification), default user seeding without hardcoded passwords, `.env.example`/`config.py` parity, checkpointer helpers, semantic chunking, chunk-id namespace isolation between keyword windows and the stored slices, config parsing, grounding helpers, JSON loading, list-endpoint SQL query-count bounds and message-history pagination, the cost of keyword recall staying tied to how much content matches rather than to knowledge-base size (issue #59: the recall SQL must carry a `LIMIT` and must not load files that never matched, asserted against a knowledge base far larger than `top_k`, and the pre-fix implementation is frozen in the file and compared item by item on content, order, score and hit evidence), knowledge base name race handling (concurrent duplicate-name create/rename, session rollback and the global IntegrityError fallback), IntegrityError diagnosis that branches on which constraint actually fired instead of reporting a name conflict for every source (issue #83 item 6: the request user's row is deleted underneath the request with `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`, through the real routes and the real global handler), the `knowledge_files.knowledge_base_id` index without which the per-base count aggregation still scans the whole table (issue #83 item 5: the with-index and without-index plans are pinned side by side via `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`, plus the migration-side backfill for databases that predate it), knowledge ownership filtering, knowledge deletion ordering, the reclamation of derived files when their owner goes away (issue #128: deleting a conversation must also delete its attachment objects from OSS, and replacing an avatar must delete the file it replaced - the OSS assertions stub `httpx.Client` at the real request egress so the method, URL and signature are checked, and two guard cases cover a first upload and a path that is its own replacement so the new deletion path cannot over-delete - the second of the two was a same-second re-upload until issue #186 replaced the `user_{id}_{timestamp}` template with a random key, which made that scenario unreachable, so it now calls the removal helper directly and a sibling case pins that two back-to-back uploads no longer land on one name), knowledge upload type and size limits, PDF text extraction from bytes constructed in the test file rather than by a PDF-writing dependency (issue #98: the Helvetica/ASCII path and the CJK path, which goes through a CID font's CMap instead of WinAnsi and which the stubbed `extract_file_text` in `test_knowledge_service.py` could never reach), learning trace handling, OpenAI-compatible URL helpers, memory context, the three missing indexes on `messages.conversation_id`, `conversations.user_id` and `conversations.knowledge_base_id` without which a page of an old conversation walks back along the primary key until the page is full and the sidebar list pays a temporary B-tree sort on top of the scan (issue #176: the with-index and without-index plans are pinned side by side as in issue #83, but the plans are taken from the statements the ORM really emitted - captured through `before_cursor_execute` and replayed with their own bound parameters - so a query that changes shape invalidates the assertion instead of quietly passing; the migration side drives `_ensure_schema_columns()` itself rather than the helper it calls, and the idempotency clause pins the helper's existing-index short-circuit by requiring the second call to log nothing, since deleting that short-circuit and letting `CREATE INDEX` fail into the swallowed-exception path leaves the index count unchanged as well), Milvus client behavior, RAGAS text handling, rerank fallback, SECRET_KEY startup guard, MYSQL_PASSWORD startup guard (issue #185: the database password gets the same treatment as SECRET_KEY - an unset or still-placeholder `MYSQL_PASSWORD` must refuse to start with an actionable message rather than being silently spliced into `DATABASE_URL`, an explicitly configured value must still pass so the guard cannot be an unconditional refusal, the placeholder is never the value in use even on a path that skips the gate, `ALLOW_INSECURE_DEFAULT_MYSQL_PASSWORD` allows startup while warning and is proven independent of `ALLOW_INSECURE_DEFAULT_SECRET` in both directions, and `.env.example` must document a placeholder instruction rather than a copyable value - see `test_env_example_parity.py`), SSE client-disconnect session cleanup (a client that goes away must still close the DB session and return the connection to the pool), internal exception text staying out of what the user receives (issue #96: neither a learning trace's SSE frames nor an `HTTPException` detail may carry the exception's own text or the `OperationalError`/`sqlite3` wording that would give the backend away, while the server-side log and a reportable id survive; the SSE cases run the real `TraceRecorder`, the real `sanitize_trace_value` and the real frame encoder and stub only persistence, since `sanitize_trace_value` does not mask an `error` key and a clean frame can therefore only come from the write side never putting the text there), the built-in secret-scan rule self-test (all five patterns, the exemption-marker boundary - including a dual-path fixture proving the marker is really consulted for the assignment hit while still failing to exempt the `sk-` shape hit on the same line - and a mutation check that neutering any single rule stops its sample from being reported, plus the gitleaks-layer attribution of issue #168, where a scanner error and a found secret have to be told apart by gitleaks' own finding marker rather than by its exit code: a scanner error must exit 2 without ever claiming a found secret, a real hit must still exit 1, and a third case pins the `--source` path reaching the native binary in a form it can open, with the target directory carrying a space and non-ASCII bytes so a broken normalisation shows up), stream fallback reset handling, trace CRUD, purging a conversation's learning trace together with the conversation (issue #127: only that conversation's rows may go - same-user traces in other conversations must survive, or emptying the table would pass as well - and both trace read paths must return nothing afterwards, including rows orphaned before the delete and rows an in-flight stream writes back), trace event `index` values staying self-consistent when a delete interleaves with a stream that is still finishing (issue #141: the write path had borrowed a read-side guard, so `get_trace_snapshot` returned `None` for a row it deemed unreadable and the caller restarted the numbering at 1; the cases pin the numbering in both the `mid_stream` and `after_finish` arms and require that the fix not buy that consistency by loosening the read guard behind #127's 404, which must keep returning `None` for a row it deems unreadable), upload validation, and reporting an upload whose text extraction produced nothing (issue #166: a PDF with no text layer used to return 200 while holding zero vectors and no stored source text, so the row could never be retrieved and had no backfill path - the cases drive the real upload route and reject it with a dedicated 400 before the metadata row and the vectors are written, pin `chunk_coverage_ratio` at 0.0 on an empty source so the existing low-coverage guard stops short-circuiting on exactly the input that loses everything, and extend the empty-content preview placeholder from `.docx` to `.pdf`/`.txt`/`.md`; the no-text PDF is built from bytes in the test file, matching `test_pdf_extraction.py`), and the knowledge-base delete path's file listing no longer instantiating whole rows (issue #179: `list_files_for_knowledge_base` carried the same root cause #61 fixed only in its sibling `list_knowledge_files`, so both callers - the one that collects ids to clean vectors and the one that only deletes rows - were pulling the LONGTEXT `content` column; the cases assert the projected column list equals the sibling's five metadata columns instead of counting statements, and the mutation matrix shows both directions matter, since a column set widened with `content` and one narrowed by a missing `created_at` each turn it red, while `defer` - which also stops the content read - is red too because it leaves six columns; the same file pins that the per-row `db.delete()` on partially loaded rows still emits a primary-key DELETE and adds no compensating per-id content read, and pins the one content read that remains, the ORM's cascade load on `KnowledgeBase.files` at `db.delete(entry)`, so it can neither be mistaken for this function's query nor change shape unnoticed), and the vision outbound exit sharing one `object_key` shape predicate with the write and delete exits (issue #181: the attachment column is echoed back by the client verbatim, so a key like `rag-chat/../../../finance-archive/secret.png` was quoted straight into a URL handed to the third-party vision service - the `..` survives `quote(key, safe="/")` and httpx normalises the path - while the write exit dropped it and the delete exit refused to sign it; the guard now sits in `_public_oss_url`, the single place a bucket URL is built, so a future caller inherits it too, and the cases assert at the request egress rather than on a helper's return value: the vision `httpx.AsyncClient` is replaced by a recorder and its record must stay empty, with positive controls pinning that a minted key still builds its URL and still sends the request, that a mixed attachment list drops only the foreign entry, and that the URL-construction probe itself fires so the "zero constructions" assertions cannot pass vacuously), and token revocation after logout or a password change (issue #184: the server had no way to invalidate an already-issued token at all - `logout` returned `{"message": "ok"}` without touching any state, and a token signed before `PUT /api/user/password` kept working for the rest of its 24h lifetime, so changing a leaked password left the leaked session online; the fix carries two independent handles in the payload, `ver` (the user's generation, bumped in the same transaction as the new hash) and `jti` (that one token), because a single handle cannot serve both cases - generation alone makes one logout kick every device the user is signed in on, and `jti` alone cannot invalidate a whole batch at once; the cases drive the real `auth_router` and `user_router` over in-memory SQLite and assert on the **status code of protected endpoints** rather than on whether a row exists, since a revocation set that is recorded but never consulted by the validation chain stays green - and both authentication chains are covered, the dependency-injected `get_current_user` and the streaming entry point that opens its own session and used to call `decode_token` directly, which is where a half-done fix leaves the old token accepted; the two-round case pins that the generation advances on every change rather than only the first, positive controls pin that fresh tokens, other sessions of the same user and other users are untouched, a token forged without the generation claim is rejected so the fix is not silently scoped to new tokens only, and the streaming entry point is shown to return its connection to a size-1 pool when authentication fails; the mutation matrix records that stripping the four revocation semantics turns eleven of the fifteen cases red while the four that stay green are exactly the positive controls, and that reverting only the streaming chain to its old shape turns all three streaming cases red), and request throttling at the two entry points that had none (issue #183: the login route counts failures per account + source address in a sliding window and answers 429 with `Retry-After` once the threshold is crossed, while a correct password inside the window still returns 200 - the positive control that keeps the fix from being a hair-trigger lockout - and the lockout is proven to expire by advancing an injected clock instead of sleeping, is scoped to the key that actually failed so a second account is untouched, and is keyed on the socket peer rather than `X-Forwarded-For` so a forged header cannot buy a fresh bucket; `POST /api/chat/stream` takes a non-blocking concurrency slot after authentication and refuses the request past the limit rather than queueing it, driven by a hanging fake upstream: the rejected request must return before the upstream is released, the stream that holds the slot must still run to `[DONE]`, and the request after it must be accepted again - which is what pins the release on all five teardown paths (normal completion, an exception raised inside the stream, a failure before the stream starts, the early return that streams the image-analysis failure, and a client disconnect through `aclose()`); and the password fields carry `max_length` at bcrypt's 72-byte input size, so an oversized password is 422 instead of reaching the comparison, with a boundary control that a password exactly at the limit still logs in), and the three list endpoints that used to answer with everything their owner had (issue #191: `list_knowledge_bases`, `list_conversations` and `list_knowledge_files` all ended their SQL in `.all()` with no page-size parameter at any of the three layers - the trade-off #61 took deliberately when it capped only the sibling message read and deferred the rest to a tracking issue that was promised in PR #81's "later" section and never opened, which is why the promise has to be quoted from that pull request's body rather than found in the tree; all three now take a keyset cursor instead of an offset, since an offset shifts under rows inserted between pages and serves one row twice while hiding another - `id` ascending for the knowledge bases and descending for the files, and a composite `(updated_at, id)` for the conversations, whose primary key is a uuid and so cannot order rows while its second-level timestamp ties within a second, which is also why the timestamp is normalised to second-level text before it is compared: the two write paths store it in different shapes and an equality against a Python datetime never holds, and the next page then re-serves exactly the rows just read; the cases pin the default page against the seeded set, page through to collect every row exactly once with a same-second arm that only the tie-breaker can order, show a doubled data set still returning one page, drive all three routes to 422 on an out-of-range limit and on a half-given cursor while a direct service call is refused rather than silently clamped the way the CRUD layer below it clamps for its own callers, and pin the probe's criterion against both a positive and a negative sample so the three reads cannot quietly go uncapped again). The last one is joined by the streaming and memory paths' synchronous DB work leaving the event loop thread (issue #187: `memory_service.py` and `chat_service.py` still opened a request-scoped `SessionLocal()` and ran `query`/`add`/`commit`/`close` on the event loop thread - the AST scan counted 11 and 17 unwrapped sinks there against 0 in the already-fixed `retrieval.py` (the 17 is a recount, not the original reading: the scan reported with #187 read 11 and 18, and the #184 auth refactor then replaced one of those bare `db.query()` calls with `authenticate(db, ...)`) - so one network DB round trip froze every concurrent request's token stream in the same process; the cases reuse the heartbeat oracle this repository already settled on for ingest and retrieval, with a ticker coroutine that must be scheduled while the call runs, which is 0 both before the fix and with the fix reverted out of the function under test, and they pin the thread rule directly rather than by timing: each Session records the thread it was opened, used and closed on, so a session handed to another thread turns red even when the timings look fine - which is also why the keyword recall now opens its own session when the caller has none, since handing `stream_chat`'s session to that worker is exactly what the issue forbids; both the entry `SessionLocal()` + user lookup and the in-stream assistant write are covered, the write steps are shown to close their own session when they raise, and the scan itself is a gate with 2 positive and 3 negative self-check cases so a zero cannot pass vacuously. Two existing assertions moved with the fix and are recorded here rather than quietly dropped: `stream_chat` no longer passes a Session to `retrieve_knowledge` (the new assertion is `is None`, and any revival of the old hand-off turns it red), and a streaming request no longer holds a pooled connection for the whole stream, so the precondition `test_sse_session_leak.py` used to assert at 1 - itself a leak detector - now asserts at 0 from the same property.

`conftest.py` puts `backend/` on `sys.path` so the tests can import application modules, and holds the test doubles shared by more than one test file: the `FakeQuery`/`FakeDb`/`FakeUser`/`FakeKnowledgeBase`/`FakeTraceRecorder` classes, the pytest fixtures built on them (`fake_user`, `fake_db`, `fake_knowledge_base`, `trace_recorder_cls`), and the SSE helpers (`collect_stream`, `parse_sse_frames`, `frames_of_type`, `streamed_content`). Test doubles used by a single file stay in that file.

`test_milvus_acceptance.py`, `test_retrieval_acceptance.py` and `test_provider_smoke.py` are the behavioral acceptance layer for the maintenance goals in `docs/MAINTENANCE_GOAL_CLOSURE.md`: a real Milvus Lite round trip (upload, query, delete, knowledge-base isolation, index rebuild), the full `retrieve_knowledge` chain (multi-route recall, RRF fusion, rerank, final context order), and the provider clients (DeepSeek, embedding, rerank and their fallbacks) including failure, timeout and malformed-response paths. They need no network and no credentials.

The provider smoke entry point is `scripts/smoke_providers.py`; it runs offline against in-process stubs by default and only reaches the real endpoints with `--live`.
